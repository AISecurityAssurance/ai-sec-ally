## Brand Voice & Messaging

### Tone

- **Professional**: Authoritative without being intimidating
- **Technical**: Precise terminology, assumes educated audience
- **Confident**: Clear value propositions, no hedging language
- **Accessible**: Complex concepts explained clearly

### Key Messages

1. **Deep Security Analysis**: "Find deep, systemic, and logical vulnerabilities—the kind that memory-safe languages and traditional tools miss"
2. **End-to-End Automation**: "Automate end-to-end security analysis from high-level STPA-Sec threat modeling down to source code"
3. **Formal Verification**: "Formally verified, machine-readable assurance case that proves security-by-design"
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: "Full transparency and control—review, refine, or override AI decisions at every step"
5. **Language Support**: "C/C++, Java, Go, Python"
6. **OWASP Alignment**: "Addresses the OWASP Top 10 'Insecure Design' category"

### Terminology

- Use "AI-Storm" (with hyphen) for the product name
- Use "STPA-Sec" (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis for Security)
- Use "assurance case" not "security report"
- Use "formally verified" when discussing output guarantees
- Use "logical vulnerabilities" or "design flaws" not just "bugs"

### Avoid

- Overly casual language
- Fear-based marketing ("Your systems are at risk!")
- Vague claims without technical substance
- Excessive jargon without explanation
- Emojis in professional content (unless explicitly requested)

## Visual Elements

### Logo Usage

- Primary logo is a shield icon (`/shield-icon.svg`)
- Animated logo available for web (`AnimatedLogo` component)
- Maintain clear space around logo equal to the height of the shield element

### Imagery Style

- Professional, clean aesthetic
- Technology-focused but not overly futuristic
- Subtle security imagery (shields, locks) used sparingly
- Avoid clichéd hacker imagery (hoodies, green matrix text)

### Animations

- `fade-in`: Subtle entrance animation (0.6s ease-out)
- `pulse-glow`: Blue glow effect for emphasis (2s infinite)
- Keep animations professional and minimal

## Application Examples

### Presentation Slides

- Use hero gradient for title slides
- Primary blue for headers and key points
- Muted backgrounds for content slides
- Accent gradient for call-to-action buttons

### Documents

- Primary blue for headings
- Foreground color for body text
- Muted foreground for secondary information
- Border color for dividers and tables

### Marketing Materials

- Lead with the AI-Storm product name
- Include the tagline on main materials
- Use accent gradient for buttons and CTAs
- Include formal verification messaging for technical audiences
