**Internship: Cybersecurity & AI Engineering**

(Unpaid / Course Credit)

*Remote (U.S.–based)*

### **About Us**

AI Security Assurance is a new, remote‑first startup building **AI‑Storm**, an AI‑powered platform that bridges high‑level systems‑theoretic security analysis with actual source code to reveal design flaws. Our mission is to help engineers design and verify secure systems across software, cyber‑physical, hardware, and organizational domains. We operate as a distributed team across the United States and are open about our progress and challenges.

### **Internship Overview**

We’re launching an internship program designed to give students hands‑on experience while earning course credit. As an intern, you’ll work with our engineering and research teams on projects that match your interests and academic requirements. We offer opportunities in:

* **Website UI Development** – assist with front‑end design and implementation using React/TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.  
* **Security Analysis & Research** – help evaluate systems using our STPA‑Sec–based methodology; assist with static/dynamic analysis and threat modeling.  
* **Software Engineering** – contribute to Python/TypeScript codebases, build backend services or pipelines, and expose APIs for other components.  
* **AI/ML Engineering** – support integration of language models for program analysis and build evaluation datasets.  
* **Formal verification** – support development on automated formal verification tools.

We will work with your school to coordinate academic credit and ensure the internship aligns with your institution’s requirements.

### **What We’re Looking For**

**Must‑Haves**

* Current enrollment in a Bachelor’s or Master’s program in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Data Science, Cybersecurity, or a related field.  
* Strong interest in cybersecurity, software development, or artificial intelligence and machine learning.  
* Ability to commit \~10–20 hours per week during the semester or 40 hours per week during the summer.  
* Excellent communication skills and ability to collaborate in a remote environment.

**Nice‑to‑Haves**

* Experience with Python and/or JavaScript/TypeScript.  
* Familiarity with React, REST APIs, or database technologies.  
* Exposure to cybersecurity frameworks or vulnerability databases.  
* Knowledge of AI/ML concepts (e.g., LLMs, embeddings), formal methods, or STPA‑Sec.

### **What We Offer**

* A **remote‑first** work environment with flexible hours.  
* Mentorship from experienced security researchers and engineers.  
* Real‑world experience with cutting‑edge cybersecurity and AI technologies.  
* Coordination with your academic program for **course credit**.  
* The possibility of future paid employment if our company secures funding and you perform well.

### **How to Apply**

Email your résumé, a brief cover letter describing your interests, and any project links to **careers@aisecurityassurance.com** with “Cybersecurity & AI Internship” in the subject. Tell us your preferred focus area (UI, security research, software engineering, or AI/ML) and include contact information for your academic advisor so we can confirm credit requirements.

**Transparency Note:** This internship is **unpaid** and intended primarily for educational purposes; we will coordinate with your school to ensure you receive appropriate credit. The internship period is tied to your academic term and will not exceed the duration needed to meet your program’s requirements. Continuing with the company beyond the internship will depend on performance and on our obtaining additional funding for paid positions. We value candidates who are excited to learn, collaborate, and contribute to our mission.
